# BurnMyMoneyOnline

BurnMyMoney.Online is a novel and exciting way for burgeoning young investors inspired by the great GME short squeeze of 2021 to grow their money in a responsible and efficient way.
The premise is simple. 
A button that buys a randomly selected stock from the 25 most volatile stocks in the last 24 hours.
